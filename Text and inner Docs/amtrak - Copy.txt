Reasons not to use Amtrak
2019-01-10

Reportedly Amtrak stopped demanding ID to buy a ticket in December 2017. Maybe there is no longer any reason not to use Amtrak.

Can anyone confirm that you can buy a ticket with a reservation without showing ID? Do they ask for a name, if you get a reservation?

The reason I stress "with a reservation" is that some trains on the Northeast Corridor require a reservation.

Don't use Amtrak until it stops demanding to see the passenger's ID. Take a bus instead. Most buses in the US do not require passengers to show ID, and if they ask for data such as a name, you can give any name.

(Don't spoil your anonymity by paying with something other than cash.)
