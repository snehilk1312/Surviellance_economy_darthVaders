<h1>Reasons not to use Uber</h1>

<blockquote>
We should not accept the promotional term "sharing economy" for
companies like Uber.  That is spin.  A more accurate term is
"piecework subcontractor economy".
</blockquote>

<p>
Uber is a big advance in massive surveillance.  Unlike a taxi,
an Uber car can't be used anonymously.  You can't pay cash.
It also requires use of nonfree software, which mistreats the user.
</p>

<p>
  Uber <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2019/02/04/all-the-bad-things-about-uber-and-lyft-in-one-simple-list/">increases
    car traffic</a>, increase wasteful driving,
  reduce use of other transit modalities, and undermine public transit.
</p>

<p>
Because I reject technology that mistreats me, I will never order or
pay for an Uber car.  Because Uber threatens to eliminate the taxis
that are acceptable to use, I go beyond that: I will not let someone
order an Uber car for me.  How about joining me?

    Uber requires passengers to identify themselves, both to order a
    ride and to pay.  (Uber
    offers <a href="https://newsroom.uber.com/macau/cash-eng/">some
    users in a few places</a> the option of paying cash, but they are
    still tracked and identified when ordering the ride.)

    Uber can track who has a one-night stand.

      it possible to turn that extra tracking off</a>, but it is still

      Uber has the technical possibility to do this because its app is nonfree:
      it is controlled by Uber, not by the user.  In addition, snooping depends
      on a nonfree operating system.  With a free system, the user could tell
      the system to lie to the Uber app.

    Uber's clever policy of not being directly responsible for anything

    <p>
      I'm not talking about the software that Uber runs in its

      that software is nonfree, it tramples Uber's freedom, but not
      the customers' freedom.  The nonfree software and digital
      services that Uber requires <em>its users</em> to use
      attack <em>their</em> freedom in various ways.

    <p>
      By the way, it is clear that Juno has the same basic
      injustice as Uber: customers must run nonfree software

      arrogant, but both of them are enemies of our
      freedom.  We should should reject both of them
      completely.

    <p>
      Uber drivers in the US get a median net income of around $15 per
      hour (as of 2018).  But when the costs of driving are deducted,

  <li>
    Cities and even public service campaigns are outsourcing
    transportation to Uber, which is a form of
    <a href="http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/38725-uber-and-lyft-are-threatening-to-expose-poor-and-elderly-to-predatory-practices">privatization of public transit</a>.
    This excludes poor people, and subjects those who do use the service
    to being tracked.
    <p>
      Lyft is no better than Uber in this regard.
  </li>


  <li>
    Uber has
    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/29/uber-penalty-fees-late-passengers">changed
      the regulations</a> that cover charging passengers for making cars wait.
    <p>
      This decision itself may not be objectionable. Taxis typically charge
      for making them wait. But that regulation is set by a city agency
      which is at least somewhat responsible to the people. Uber is a
      business headquartered somewhere else, which accepts no responsibility
      to the people of any city.
    <p>
      We should not allow a company to privatize the making of the
      regulations that create our social order.

  <li>
    <p>
      Beware of thinking of Uber as one more option in addition to real
      taxis.  At the moment, that's true, but if Uber is a big success,

<h2 id ="discrimination">Discrimination</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
    Uber has set up a social credit system: passengers that get bad
    ratings from drivers will be
    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/31/uber-to-ban-riders-with-low-ratings">blacklisted</a>
    (refused disservice).</p>
    <p>
    One must suspect that customers' racial and ethnic appearance
    influences the ratings, so one effect will be discrimination.
    However, the chinification will do wrong to every customer,
    including those who are blacklisted, and those who only face the
    possibility of being blacklisted.</p>
    <p>
    This reinforces my conclusion that transportation services should
    not be allowed to identify their customers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/31/uber-lyft-racial-discrimination-us-boston-seattle">
    Uber systematically discriminates against passengers that are black,
    and tends to cheat women.
    </a>
    <p>
    The study does not demonstrate how the discrimination and cheating occur,
    but does demonstrate the statistical phenomenon.
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Uber <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/13/uber-lyft-prices-personalized-data">charges different prices</a> to different people.  Other companies
      also engage, or have engaged, in price discrimination.  It turns out
      that identifying customers helps many businesses put customers at a
      disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only thorough solution is to do what is needed for other reasons:
      eliminate the systems that let companies know who the customer is.

      Guber programmed its system for special treatment of people that
      might be investigating accusations of violating municipal

    <p>
    I would guess that the safety monitors would be hard-pressed to

    Uber seems to be harassing its competitor, Lyft, by

    Lyft doesn't do all the nasty things that Uber does, but it does

    Uber is losing a lot of money every year, but we cannot tell how much
    because it releases only <a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2018/02/can-uber-ever-deliver-part-thirteen-even-4q-cost-cuts-uber-lost-4-5-billion-2017.html">vaguely
    defined accounting information</a>,
    insufficient to tell its real losses.</p>
    <p>
    This is crucial because it can't keep this up indefinitely.
    Some day it will have to raise its prices quite a bit.
    If Uber customers patronize Uber so much now that its competitors
    disappear before that day, they will regret their actions
    when the price goes up.</p>

    Guber <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/30/uber-denies-misleading-passenger\

    shows "phantom" cars on the map</a>, giving would-be passengers
    the impression that a car is available close by.
    <p>
      Guber denies doing this, but I don't trust Guber.

    Guber <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/07/have-ubers-phantom-cars-disappeared">appears

    they existed.

    Journalist Sarah Lacy writes about how an Uber executive
    <a href="http://pando.com/2014/11/17/the-moment-i-learned-just-how-far-uber-will-go-to-silence-journalists-and-attack-women/">
      said he would
      punish her critical journalism by using lies to smear her family life</a>.
    It was the culmination of Uber's years of contempt for the company's
    drivers and passengers.
    <p>
      By the way, I don't see anything wrong in offering taxi rides driven
      by attractive models of either sex.  However, this need not and should
      not be accompanied by Uber-style contempt towards women (and men).

      Uber and Lyft have substantially

      and congestion</a> in San Francisco, and cut the ridership of
      buses and trains as well as the amount people walk.

      Uber has always intentionally operated at a loss. This enabled Uber
      to undercut competition. However, lately it has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/08/uber-quarterly-earnings-loss-stocks-shares">losing more than
	a billion dollars a month</a>.</p>
    <p>
      This makes Uber vulnerable. Drive in the stake &mdash; cut off Uber now!</p>
