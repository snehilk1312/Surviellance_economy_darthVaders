Technologiesthat could have empowered us are used to chain us instead.With printed books,•You can buy one with cash, anonymously.•Then you own it.•You are not required to sign a license that restricts your use of it.•The format is known, and no proprietary technology is needed to read the book.•You have the right to give, lend or sell the book to another.•You can, physically, copy the book, and it's sometimes lawful under copyright.•Nobody has the power to remotely destroy your book.Contrast that with Amazon ebooks (fairly typical):•Amazon requires users to identify themselves to get an ebook.•In some countries, including the US, Amazon says the user cannot own the ebook.•Amazon requires the user to accept a restrictive license on use of the ebook.•The format is secret and only proprietary user-restricting software lawfully supports it.•The Kindle tells Amazon what page the user is reading, plus any notes the user enters.•An ersatz “lending” is allowed for some books, for a limited time, but only byspecifying by name another user of the same system.  No giving or selling.•Copying the ebook is blocked by Digital Restrictions Management .•Amazon can remotely delete the ebook using a back door. In 2009, Amazon deleted thousands of copies of George Orwell's 1984. this way.•Amazon can do anythingto a Kindle user through a universal back door.
